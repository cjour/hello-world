# hello-world
Just a repository test
Hi everyone, I am an ex Neurosciences researcher moving from biology to computer sciences.
After working on finding chemical solution to restore normal-like phenotype of SOD1 G93A mice, I have decided to move on !
I hope to find interesting open source project I can work on.
